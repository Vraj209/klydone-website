**General Principles**

- Apply **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS** principles consistently throughout the codebase.
- Follow **frontend architecture best practices** for scalability, readability, and maintainability.
- Ensure all code is **production-ready** and adheres to **enterprise-level standards**.

**Code Quality**

- Write **efficient, clean, and modular** code.
- Maintain **high readability** — variable, function, and component names must clearly express intent.
- Avoid redundant logic — **reuse existing components** instead of duplicating code.
- **No comments** should be used; code should be self-explanatory.
- **No Markdown (.md) files** or placeholder documentation should be generated.
- **No icons** or decorative assets unless explicitly required.

**Architecture & Structure**

- Use a **component-based folder structure**, keeping related logic and styling encapsulated.
- Ensure **SEO-friendly structure** — semantic HTML, optimized metadata, and accessibility compliance.
- Maintain **consistent coding conventions** (naming, indentation, imports, file naming).
- Ensure modularity for scalability and easy testing.

**Performance**

- Prioritize **performance and optimization** in rendering, state management, and API handling.
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders and bundle size.

### **Responsive Design**

- Follow a **mobile-first** design approach with fluid layouts.
- Ensure **cross-device and cross-browser compatibility** (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use **relative units (%, rem, vw/vh)** for flexible scaling.
- Test and adjust **breakpoints** for all major screen sizes.
- Maintain **consistent spacing, typography, and layout behavior** across resolutions.
- Ensure interactive elements (buttons, inputs, navigation) are **touch-friendly and accessible**.
